## Description

**Chordgraphs** are an interesting data visualization tool that allows item relationships to be easily seen. Each item in a collection of items is linked to any other that match some criteria by drawing an arc or "chord" between them. Typically the items are laid out around a circle similar to a clock face with minute markers. Chord colors, transparency, thickness, control points, and other features can be used to further show aspects of relationships.

**This app** uses a chordgraph on text entered in a text box on the same activity. It uses the Android Canvas and 2D drawing api to create the graphics.

## Instructions
1. Just launch the app and edit the text in the "Enter Text:" text box.
2. The graph will update automatically.

## Notes
It is interesting to play around with well know lyrics/speeches/poems to see the pattern of word repetition and the resulting circular graph.

Here are some examples:

"Mary had a little lamb..."

"Dust in the wind..."

"Four Score and Seven years ago..."
